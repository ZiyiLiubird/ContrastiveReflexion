Particularly, I found a cd and a desklamp, and then used the desklamp to examine the cd as required. In the second task, I found a soapbar, cleaned it and put it on the countertop. Every step taken brought me closer to completing the task and I ensured I had possession of the item before moving onto the next part of the task.",

Both tasks, [put two cellphone in sofa] and [put two creditcard in dresser], were accurately executed according to the task's instruction. Both the first and second cellphones were found and placed in/on the sofa, and so were the creditcards in the dresser.",

Be prepared to provide the log of your actions for them to clearly comprehend the situation."
