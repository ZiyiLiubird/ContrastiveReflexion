                "failure reason": "In the scenario where the task failed, the main reason for failure is that the robot was not successful in finding a watch to put in the safe. The robot attempted to search all possible places such as cabinets, drawers, shelves, and other furniture. However, the search was unsuccessful because the watch may not have been present in the environment, or it was in a place that hadn\u2019t been checked. The actions 'open cabinet 4', 'open drawer 1', 'open cabinet 5' were repeated multiple times which were unnecessary and the robot did not manoeuvre to each location before attempting to open them.",

Start by thinking where the watch might more likely be found and systematically search these places. It would be better to perform 'go to' before attempting to 'open' any cabinet, drawer or shelf. This would evade any chances of accidental repeated attempts of opening the same furniture. Furthermore, checking other objects present in the room such as under the pillow or in the garbage can could also uncover the watch."
