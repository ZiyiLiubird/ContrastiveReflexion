Therefore, I need to reevaluate my strategy.\n\nNew plan: Since I couldn't find a peppershaker in the usual places, I should consider the possibility that it might be in a different location, such as the drawer. I will check the drawers one by one, starting with drawer 1. If I still can't find a peppershaker, I will think of alternative ways to achieve the task, such as using a different container with a similar function."
