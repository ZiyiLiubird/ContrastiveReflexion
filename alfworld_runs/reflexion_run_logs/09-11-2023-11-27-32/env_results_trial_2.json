First, I identified what items were needed to complete the task and where they were most likely found in the environment. Then, I systematically explored those areas, opened any closed objects if necessary, and took the required items. Finally, I correctly used or placed the items as per the task requirement. It seems that keeping track of the environment and the location of items, and executing actions in the correct sequence is crucial for successfully completing the task.",

I not only need to remember to open containers first but also to verify that it's the appropriate type of container for the object in question. In the case of hot items in particular, it might be best to place them in a designated cabinet for heated items, if such a cabinet exists in the environment."
