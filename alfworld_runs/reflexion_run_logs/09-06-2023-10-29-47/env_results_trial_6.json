From my previous attempt, I realized that I should have looked for the desklamp first before looking for the bowl. I will start by searching for the desklamp on desk 1 since I know it is located there. Once I have found the desklamp, I will look for the bowl on desk 2 since I know it's more likely to appear on a desk or shelf. If I am unable to find the bowl on desk 2, I will search the shelves in a systematic way by checking shelf 1 first, then shelf 2, and finally shelf 3. Once I have found the bowl, I will turn on the desklamp and look at the bowl under it. If I am unsuccessful with this plan, I will rethink my strategy and search for the bowl and desklamp more systematically.",
