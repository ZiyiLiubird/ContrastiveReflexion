Before attempting to cool, ensure to open the fridge door first, before cooling the pan with the fridge. Thereafter, placing the cooled pan on the countertop. Also, it's important to adapt to environment feedback and avoid repeating the same actions that are not contributing to task completion."

Once I have the pan, I should remember to open the fridge door before trying to cool the pan with the fridge. After cooling the pan, I should place it on the countertop, choosing the appropriate one based on environment feedback and avoiding repetition of actions that do not yield favorable outcomes."

                "failure reason": "The main reason for the unsuccessful completion of the task was forming a loop of repeated and unfruitful actions without adapting to feedback from the environment. I got stuck in interacting with the stoveburner or fridge, or placing the pan onto the countertop, without realizing these actions were not leading to successful task completion.",
                "suggestions": "To complete the task successfully, I should follow a more structured approach: 1) Find and take a pan, likely from the stoveburner or cabinets; 2) Remember to open the fridge door first, then cool the pan with the fridge; 3) Place the cooled pan on the countertop, strategically choosing among the available countertops based on environment feedback. Importantly, if a repeated action does not yield fruitful results, I should avoid repeating it and instead try a new approach."
